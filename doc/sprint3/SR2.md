## Unfinished tasks and group them into stories; add them to SR1.md in the form of new user stories.

    #### Feedback from S2 Demo:
    - Make spacing adjustments for first name and last name fields on profile Page
    - Provide a users with search recommendations by adding dropdown to search bar
      on the shoppingPage

## What are practices that you should continue during next sprint
- Having frequent meetings.
- Having informative commit messages.
- Having a practice demo meeting before sprint demo.

## What are some new practices that you might want to use during next sprint
- Be more open to asking TAs for help or guidance when faced with technical challenges

## What are (if any) harmful practices you should stop using during next sprint
- Try to avoid removing and/or adding new stories later on in the sprint to more closely match the burndown chart expectations.  
- Avoid starting out with complex implementations which can be overwhelming and unrealistic. Instead, prioritize basic functionalities during implementations then add onto those functionalities later on, in order to make it more complex.

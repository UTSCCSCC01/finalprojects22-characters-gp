# Sprint 3 Planning Meeting
## Sprint Goals

3. As a consumer I want to be able to search for apparel by story titles and apparel types, so that I can quickly access/purchase items I'm interested in
4. As a consumer I want to be able to access a list of products that I bought with the price of each item so that I can track the history of my orders
7. As an employee I want to be able to filter between submissions for custom-made items and submissions for Character stories, so that I can conduct the next steps accordingly
5. As a consumer I want to be able to receive a receipt of my order via email so that I am able to confirm that my order was correct and was successfully processed.
8. As a consumer/character/employee I want to hide the navbar in a menu button so that I can focus on achieving whatever I want on the website

As an employee I want to be able to see a queue of orders backlog so that I can ensure they are fulfilled on time

## Tasks Breakdown
3. As a consumer I want to be able to search for apparel by story titles and apparel types, so that I can quickly access/purchase items I'm interested in (Eric Zhou)
  - Provide a filter apparel in store page by story titles so consumers can see apparels by certain characters.
  - Add product type field: hat, shirt, pants, etc. for a radio/select filter.

5. As a consumer I want to be able to receive a receipt of my order via email so that I am able to confirm that my order was correct and was successfully processed. (Aya)
  - As a non-logged-in consumer I want to be prompted to signup/login when trying to pay for the items in the shopping cart
  - Fetch the user's email after payment is processed 
  - Send order details and receipt to the user 

8. As a consumer/character/employee I want to hide the navbar in a menu button so that I can focus on achieving whatever I want on the website
(Sung Ha)
  - When the screen is in a mobile aspect ratio, the navbar will be transformed to a "hamburger style" menu button
  - The navigation drawer will appear when the hamburger menu is pressed.

4. As a consumer I want to be able to access a list of products that I bought with the price of each item so that I can track the history of my orders

   - Create mock checkoutPage that stores shipping and billing information for a user's order(s) 

7. As an employee I want to be able to filter between story submissions based off different criteria, so that I can conduct the next steps accordingly

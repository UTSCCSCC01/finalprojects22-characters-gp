## Unfinished tasks and group them into stories; add them to SR1.md in the form of new user stories.
- No unfinished tasks, but there is some feedback from the demo that we will be working on in Sprint 2:
    #### Feedback from S1 Demo:
    - Password fields are too wide
    - Add password security
    - Simplify UI by hiding Sign-up page in Login page via a link

## What are practices that you should continue during next sprint
- Having frequent meetings.
- Having informative commit messages.
- Having a practice demo meeting before sprint demo.

## What are some new practices that you might want to use during next sprint
- Be more open to asking TAs for help or guidance when faced with technical challenges

## What are (if any) harmful practices you should stop using during next sprint
- Try to avoid removing and/or adding new stories later on in the sprint to more closely match the burndown chart expectations.  
- Avoid starting out with complex implementations which can be overwhelming and unrealistic. Instead, prioritize basic functionalities during implementations then add onto those functionalities later on, in order to make it more complex.

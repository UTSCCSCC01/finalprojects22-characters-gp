# Release Planning Meeting
## Release Goal
Our release goal is to complete the stories in the product backlog and fix all debugs that we encounter.

## Scope of the Project (at least in terms of epics/key features)
The core features for our project are the following:
- Characters can send/share their stories to employees via a form through the website (CHAR-1, CHAR-4, CHAR-8, CHAR-10, CHAR-19)
- Consumers should be able to browse and buy apparel on the website (CHAR-5, CHAR-7, CHAR-12, CHAR-13, CHAR-14, CHAR-16)
- Users should be able to have an account to access their information (CHAR-2, CHAR-6, CHAR-9, CHAR-15, CHAR-18)

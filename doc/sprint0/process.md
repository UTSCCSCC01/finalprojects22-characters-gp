## Team Organization

Our team has decided to use Discord as its primary form of communication. Any new updates regarding the project and/or additional scheduled meetings (outside of standard weekly standup meetings) will be announced on Discord.

Our team has mutually agreed that there will be no assigned roles in regards to the team's structure (other than Fady, the <b>Characters</b> representative, as the Product Owner). Instead, each team member will be responsible for contributing (to some degree) towards the project's front-end, back-end and database components.

<b>Note: This is for the time being, and may be subject to change.</b> 

## Decision-making
Our team's decision-making process begins with an evaluation of the available options. Following this will be a discussion period where team members generate a list of pros and cons for each option, in attempt to mutually agree on a single option. 

In instances where a mutual agreement cannot be met, our team will make the decision on a democratic basis. That is to say, each team member will take turns persuading other group members to vote for their option, and the option with the highest number of votes is chosen.  

## User Stories & Priority (further elaborate)

The Planning Poker technique was used to provide an estimation for the priority of user stories. For every user story, team members presented a number value representative of how complex they believe that user story to be. This process was repeated until the team reached a consensus, wherein every team member presented the same number value. 

## Meetings
In total, our team has hosted 5 different meetings to discuss the sprint0 deliverables (details below). Future meetings will occur on Tuesday 2:00-2:30pm, Thursday 3:00-3:30 pm and Friday 3:00-3:30 pm every week, on a flexible basis.

## Next Phase

Coordinating and scheduling meetings that are suitable for everyone's schedule has been the greatest challenge for our team thus far. Since our team consists of 5 different members, all of whom have priorities outside of school, including work, internships, and time for personal projects, it can be difficult to establish meeting times that every team member can attend on a recurring basis. In addition to this, the <b>Characters</b> representative, Fady, is our Product Owner and plays an integral component in ensuring the client's expectations are satisfied. Thus, additional meetings would have to be arranged according to his schedule.

Going forward, our team will strive for flexibility in our schedules. If there is a mandatory meeting that one team member may not be able to attend, then the team member that cannot attend is expected to vocalize their time conflict via Discord and the rest of the team members should reschedule the meeting to a time suitable for everyone. In some cases a team meeting may continue without all team members being present, in which case the missing team member(s) will be updated on key information that was discussed during the meeting via Discord.

Going forward, our team will also strive for conciseness in our meetings. We value everyone's time, and so team meetings should only discuss topics that require the ideas, opinions, knowledge of each team member whereas the actual work/implementation of project components will be distributed between team members to be finished on their own time, by a specified deadline.

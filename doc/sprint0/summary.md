# Objective 
The objective of this project is to build a web application to showcase people's unique story through apparels and NFTs. The web application is used for consumers whom want to purchase character's apparels and learn about the character's experiences. Anyone could upload their story onto the web application so that an employee could review and process potential character applications. The apparels have QR code features, where once scanned, it will bring the scanner to the character's story.

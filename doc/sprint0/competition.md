Despite being a very unique idea, there are many companies, stores and organizations that share some features, especially the e-commerce aspect of Characters that could be considered competition. Some of these competitors are:

Clothing Stores with Online Shopping (i.e. H&M, Urban Planet, Old Navy)
- https://www2.hm.com/en_ca/index.html
- https://urban-planet.com/
- https://oldnavy.gap.com/

- Clothing stores like the stores listed above, all provide customers with “trendy",fashionable clothing and as such they have many customers. These stores all have the option to shop online allowing for a convenient way for anybody to view and purchase items from anywhere The web application for Characters will also be a place where customers can shop for a variety of clothing online.
- The users of such clothing stores like H&M is any type of person. Clothing is something that everyone uses and the above mentioned stores hold clothing for all occasions at reasonable prices as such the customers of such stores are everyone.
- Characters will provide a unique perspective on fashion as one of the products it will be selling is clothing. The difference between users that will buy from the conventional clothing stores and from Characters is that at Characters customers will be able to pick clothing that has been meticulously designed to eloquently represent a person's story. This means that not only will the money from any clothing purchased go partially towards the original story owner, but if a customer comes across a piece of clothing whose story resonates with them, they will be able to make a meaningful purchase and potentially feel an emotional connection to the person's story. Conventional clothing stores are not able to provide this aspect of online clothes shopping.
- For competitors to be able to provide these aspects of clothes shopping they would have to invest a great amount of time and resources to make sure that every piece of clothing holds meaning. This is something that Characters is willing to do and as such the time, money and effort will likely be higher, nonetheless it will allow the company to deliver high quality clothing to users who wish to support others struggles.
    
Merch Companies(i.e. Designhill, printify)

- https://printify.com/
    
- Merch companies like the ones linked above allow the customer to custom create clothing or other products using templates provided by the company. Users of such companies are potentially organizations that would like their logo or branding on a variety of products, people who are looking to create many of one type of clothing or product (for example for team products or family reunions). Merch companies allow the user to custom create clothing to their liking.
- Users of Characters will also have semi-custom created products but these people will also get their clothing and other products designed by professionals so that the result is a high-scale, good-quality product that effectively represents the story of the user.
- Characters allows story owners to profit off the items sold that represent their story. Users can submit their stories free of charge and if approved, once they’re product has been designed and released they will receive a portion of the profit. In order for someone to make profit from a Merch company they must first buy any merchandise they wish to sell, and then resell it. Characters gives any person, of any financial status the potential ability to benefit from sharing their story.
